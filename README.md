# Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization #

Time keeping is crucial for security, privacy, and anonymity. Sdwdate is a Tor
friendly replacement for rdate and ntpdate that sets the system's clock by
communicating via onion encrypted TCP with Tor onion webservers.

At randomized intervals, sdwdate connects to a variety of webservers and
extracts the time stamps from http headers (RFC 2616).
Using sclockadj option, time is gradually adjusted preventing bigger clock
jumps that could confuse logs, servers, Tor, i2p, etc.

This package contains the sdwdate time fetcher and daemon. No
installation on remote servers required. To avoid conflicts, this daemon
should not be enabled together with ntp or tlsdated.

(This package description has been [automatically](https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/debug-steps/packaging-helper-script) extracted and mirrored from `debian/control`.)

## Cooperating Anonymity Distributions ##

[Generic Readme](https://github.com/Whonix/whonix-developer-meta-files/blob/master/README_generic.md) beings here. Have a look into the `man` sub folder (if available).

The functionality of this package was once exclusively available in the [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org) ([github](https://github.com/Whonix/Whonix)) anonymity distribution.

Because multiple projects and individuals stated interest in various of Whonix's functionality (examples: [Qubes OS](http://qubes-os.org/trac) ([discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/qubes-devel/jxr89--oGs0)); [piratelinux](https://github.com/piratelinux) ([discussion](https://github.com/adrelanos/VPN-Firewall/commit/6147f0e606377f5a801e98daf22e24ba2c750a21#commitcomment-6360713))), it's best to share as much source code as possible, it's best to share certain characteristics [(such as /etc/hostname etc.) among all anonymity distributions](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-January/002457.html)) Whonix has been split into [multiple separate packages](https://github.com/Whonix).

## Generic Packaging ##

Files in `etc/...` in root source folder will be installed to `/etc/...`, files in `usr/...` will be installed to `/usr/...` and so forth. This should make renaming, moving files around, packaging, etc. very simple. Packaging of most packages looks very similar.

## How to use outside of Debian or derivatives ##

Although probably due to generic packaging not very hard. Still, this requires developer skills. [Ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting) welcome!

## How to Build deb Package ##

See comments below and [instructions](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/apparmor-profile-torbrowser).

* Replace `apparmor-profile-torbrowser` with the actual name of this package (equals the root source folder name of this package after you git cloned it).
* You only need [config-package-dev](https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/config-package-dev), when it is listed in the `Build-Depends:` field in `debian/control`.
* Many packages do not have signed git tags yet. You may request them if desired.
* We might later use a [documentation template](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Template:Build_Documentation_Build_Package).

## How to install in Debian using apt-get ##

Binary packages are available in Whonix's APT repository. By no means you are required to use the binary version of this package. This might be interesting for users of Debian and derivatives. **Note, that usage of this package outside of Whonix is untested and there is no maintainer that supports this use case.**

1\. Get [Whonix's Signing Key](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Signing_Key).

2\. Add Whonix's Signing Key to apt-key.

```
gpg --export 916B8D99C38EAF5E8ADC7A2A8D66066A2EEACCDA | sudo apt-key add -
```

3\. Add Whonix's APT repository.

```
echo "deb http://deb.whonix.org jessie main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/whonix.list
```

4\. Update your package lists.

```
sudo apt-get update
```

5\. Install this package. Replace `package-name` with the actual name of this package.

```
sudo apt-get install package-name
```
